# Topic-Modelling

Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are often used for topic modelling. While most blogs explain how they can be applied using the Gensim or scikit-learn library, less is known about the optimization of these models.

The proposed code uses the scikit-learn pipeline to connect classes for data preprocessing, data transformation and topic modelling. The gensim coherence model is integrated into a GridSearch and used to evaluate the topic composition.
